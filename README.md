## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Through this analysis we can see that Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance provided non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. Vehicle Weight may also have provided a slight amount of variance to mpg values, but using 0.05 as significance level, this is not significant.The slope of the linear model is not zero since we see the P-value of this test is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than significance level of 0.05. 
Overall, this test does a reasonable job of predicting mpg since the R-squared value is 0.71. This indicates that the model will predict correctly 71% of time.
